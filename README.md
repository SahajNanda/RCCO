<p>Purpose: A device to open and close your curtains to the degree of your choosing with a remote,<br>
so you can control light and privacy without getting up. </p>

<p>Materials List:<br>
Arduino<br>
Step Motor 28BYJ-48 (Connected to Arduino pins 8, 9, 10, 11)<br>
ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver Module<br>
IR Receiver Module (Connected to Arduino pin 7)<br>
IR Remote<br>
Breadboard</p>

<p>Issues Faced:<br>
Ensuring all the physical connections were correct and working proved difficult, and took some <br>
troubleshooting to make sure the hardware was performing properly. Also, the speed of the motor <br>
was quite slow, and attachments will be needed to make the raising/lowering more efficient.</p>

<p>Public Frameworks used:<br>
Arduino Library</p>
